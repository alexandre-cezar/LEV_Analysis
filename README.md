To execute this code, add all the dependency packages using pip3:

`apt-get -y install python3-pip`

- `pip3 install requests`
- `pip3 install pandas` 
- `pip3 install tqdm` 
- `pip3 install tenacity` 
- `pip3 install openpyxl`

And after all dependencies are in place, execute the code by `running python3 LEV_Comparisonv2.py`

Review the resulting spreadsheet.
